This project is an extension of the World Of Zuul code by Michael Kolling
and David J. Barnes

This project is a framework for an adventure learning game.

The application will start by running the program.

In this game the goal is to make a T-Shirt.

This version includes multiple rooms with the ability for a player to point
and click to the different rooms.

In those rooms there are different objectives to do and items for the play
to interact with.

You can change the room you are in by clicking on signs and doors. Items are
picked up by clicking on them and then choosing if you want to pick them up or
not. The items are used by opening the inventory, clicking on the item in the
inventory and then either click use or drop. Hints to what to do next are available
by clicking on the “!” icon.

The game includes following commands:
- Use
- Drop
- Yes
- No
- Start
- Quit
